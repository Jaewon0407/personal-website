Overview: In this project, I created a personal project that highlight 3 sections. The first section is the home page that shows the current title of my position and my profile (profile picture, interest, studies). The home page also consists of social media platforms, which the user can access by clicking. I also created a project section that shows all my projects, where each project contains a description and multiple images that show the highlights of the project. Finally, the last section is my resume page that shows my resume in a clear view.
